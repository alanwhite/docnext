								<h5>Creating Drum Scores</h5>
								<p>An important initial note is that the current version of
									Drum Score Editor does not contain an auto-save feature. It is
									recommended all work is saved often. Drum Score Editor does
									track changes made, allowing undo of almost all actions which
									change the content of the score, and will prompt the user to
									save a score when closing it. Drum Score Editor will always be
									over-cautious in detecting unsaved changes and depending on the
									types of changes made, may choose to prompt the user to save in
									any case.</p>
								<h5>Generating New Scores</h5>
								<p>One of the features that Drum Score Editor brings that
									helps eliminate significant time and complexity usually found
									in setting out a new score is the Score Setup Wizard, also
									known as the Score Generator. Accessed through the File->New
									menu, or on a Mac the CMD-N keystroke, CTRL-N on Windows, the
									setup wizard prompts for the information needed to lay out the
									score, using the dialogue box below.</p>
								<img src="images/newscore.png" />
								<p></p>
								<b>Title</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor uses this information to store the
									entered text in the title property of the score, and creates a
									title text area, linked to the property on the generated score.
								</p>
								<b>Author</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor uses this information to store the
									entered text in the author property of the score, and creates
									an author text area, linked to the property on the generated
									score.</p>
								<b>Band</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor uses this information to store the
									entered text in the band property of the score.</p>
								<b>Tune Type</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor uses this information to store the
									entered text in the tune type property of the score, and
									creates a tune type text area, linked to the property on the
									generated score. The value of the tune type is used in
									conjunction with the other information provided in calculating
									the number of bars in a part and where to use repeat bar marks.
								</p>
								<b>Time Signature</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor uses this information to store the
									entered text in the time signature property of the score, and
									creates a music area with no visible staff lines to hold the
									time signature. The time signature in the music area is linked
									to the property on the generated score, meaning if the time
									signature is later changed in the score properties, the value
									showing on the score in this music area will also be updated.</p>
								<b>Number of parts</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor will create the appropriate number of
									staff lines in a music area, as determined by a combination of
									this information, the tune type, the time signature and the
									bars per line. The current version of Drum Score Editor doesnâ€™t
									allow specification of additional staff lines for 1st and 2nd
									times at initial score generation time, however these can be
									added using the Format->Staff->Insert Staff menu items. As a
									feature, all text areas in Drum Score Editor will always sit in
									front of any music area, allowing placement of text anywhere on
									the page, 1st and 2nd time text being common uses.</p>
								<b>Bars per line</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor will use this information to determine
									how many bars will appear on each staff line, and in
									conjunction with the anacrusis setting, create bar lines at the
									appropriate places on each staff line.</p>
								<b>Beats per minute</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor will use this information to record the
									preferred beats per minute for the score.</p>
								<b>Anacrusis %</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor will leave the specified percentage of
									each staff line free for any anacrusis required. If no
									anacrusis space is required, this should be set to 0.</p>
								<b>Paper Size</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor will create a single page of the
									dimensions of the paper type specified. The current version of
									Drum Score Editor understands the ISO A3 and A4 formats, plus
									the American Legal and Letter sizes.</p>
								<b>Page Orientation</b>
								<p>Drum Score Editor uses the specified page orientation in
									conjunction with the Paper Size setting to create a single page
									of the right shape and size.</p>

								<h5>The Generated Score</h5>
								<p>The figure below shows the properties and layout of a
									score generated by the Score Setup Wizard dialogue using a
									landscape format for a 4 parted march.</p>
								<img style="border: 1px solid black" src="images/generatedscore.png" />
								<p></p>
								<p>The Score Setup Wizard in Drum Score Editor will always
									create the time signature, tune type, title and author text
									areas at the top of the page as in the above figure, with the
									time signature and tune type on the left hand side, the title
									centred on the page and the author text area right aligned at
									the right edge.</p>
								<p>At the foot of the page is a text area with the band
									name, and one with the date of score generation in it.</p>
								<p>The music area is always created to use the rest of the
									page and is pre-populated with the number of staff lines and
									bar lines in the appropriate places, as determined by the
									information provided in the Score Setup Wizard dialogue.</p>
								<p>The position and size of of the generated text and music
									areas can be changed using the mouse as described in Starting
									Principles above.</p>
