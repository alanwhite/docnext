									<p>There is an ongoing issue between internet service
										companies which is preventing the automatic issue of licenses.
									</p>
									<p>
										Please email <a href="mailto:alan@whiteware.org">Alan
											White</a> if you wish to purchase a license, while we work to
										resolve this issue.
									</p>
								</div>
								<h5>Overview</h5>
								<p>
									Although time is given freely, there are numerous costs that
									mount up for developer rights and certificates as well as
									hosting and distribution costs and helping cover those is much
									appreciated. In return for contributing, some helpful
									productivity features are enabled which we call studio
									features, these are covered in detail <a
										href="studiofeatures.html">here</a>.
								</p>
								<h5>Obtaining a license</h5>
								<p>First sign in here on this site. You can either create an
									account here or use your Facebook login. The use of Facebook to
									login is strongly encouraged as it prevents the need to
									remember yet another password for a website. This feature will
									be extended to Google accounts in the future.</p>
								<p>Once signed in, a new item appears on the menu bar named
									Licenses. Clicking there will take you to a list of any
									previous licenses (contributions) you've made. This serves as
									an aide memoire in case you need your license key again.</p>
								<p>
									<img src="images/loggedinmenu.png">
								</p>
								<p>Note there is no need to acquire a separate license for
									each PC or laptop you own. The same key works on any machine
									you use, The license is tied to your identity and email address
									only. This does mean you could generously just give others your
									license key, however that means Drum Score Editor isn't getting
									the support it needs and your identity is being added to their
									machines.</p>
								<p>Click the New License button to be taken to a PayPal
									payment page where you can either use a card or a PayPal
									account if you have one to pay the displayed fee.</p>
								<img src="images/newlicensebutton.png" />

								<p>Once PayPal confirms payment, a license key is generated
									and appears in your list of licenses. Sometimes it takes many
									minutes for PayPal to confirm dependant on the card. Please
									click Licenses from the menu to refresh your list of licenses.
								</p>

								<h5>Applying the license key</h5>
								<p>Start Drum Score Editor and then use the menus to
									navigate to the license dialog.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>On Microsoft Windows this is Edit->Options</li>
									<li>On Apple Mac OS X it's Drum Score Editor->Preferences</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Once the dialog is displayed copy and paste the license
									key from the website into the area provided and click apply.
									Please make sure you copy the license key content and not the
									web address of it by selecting the whle license key displayed.</p>
								<img src="images/licprefdialog.png" />

								<p></p>
								<p>Next close down Drum Score Editor completely, as license
									checks are performed when the app starts and features enabled
									as appropriate.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>On Microsoft Windows it's File->Exit</li>
									<li>On Apple Mac OS X it's Drum Score Editor->Quit</li>
								</ul>
