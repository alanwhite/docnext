								<h5>Overview</h5>
								<p>Drum Score Editor is a software tool for documenting pipe
									band side and tenor drum scores. It is intended to be easy to
									use, but at the same time allow detailed control over the
									layout and spacing of notes. It allows the user to edit, print
									and save drumming scores on their own Windows, Mac or Linux
									laptop or PC. These pages describe the current version of Drum
									Score Editor, available for free download from this site.
									Although all screen shots in this manual are from a Mac, the
									information presented is the same on Windows.</p>
								<p>The software will never be finished as long as feedback
									continues to come in saying how it could be improved. This is
									more a vocation than a money making venture, i.e. the primary
									intention for Drum Score Editor is to make something to be
									used, not sold. Paying licenses are available, which unlock
									productivity features, howeves these are priced to help recover
									developer rights, certificates and hosting costs. All
									development time is given freely.</p>
								<h5 id="principles">Starting Principles</h5>
								<p>When Drum Score Editor is opened it presents a workspace
									in which the new score wizard can create standard text and
									score areas, pre-populating with staff lines and bars depending
									on the number of parts, time signature, tune type, anacrusis
									required and other options. Existing drum score files can be
									opened for further editing using the File -> Open menu,
									equivalent toolbar button or from the File -> Recent Files
									menu. Multiple scores can be open at the same time, one in each
									tab.</p>
								<p>As would be expected, once a score is created, it can be
									printed or saved for later use as an attachment to email for
									sharing with others. If the intended recipients do not have a
									copy of the Drum Score Editor software, the print feature of
									Drum Score Editor works well with popular PDF writing printer
									drivers on Windows, and the built-in capability on a Mac to
									create PDFs. A licensed productivity feature exists to natively
									save as a PDF.
								<p>Each score can be zoomed for finer control and better
									visibility, however it should be noted this is for working with
									the score on screen and zooming doesn't impact the printed
									score. By default a score appears on the screen at exactly the
									same physical size as the paper type chosen in the File ->
									Print Properties dialog.</p>
								<p>As described above, the two types of content on a page of
									a score are either text annotations or areas that contain the
									musical symbols that represent drumming. These are called text
									areas and music areas respectively. They are created on the
									page either by the generator feature or by an advanced user
									from the Insert menu or the Score and Staff buttons on the main
									toolbar.</p>
								<p>Once created they can be moved around the page using the
									mouse, by clicking and holding the mouse button down over the
									border, and dragging it to the new location. Text or music
									areas can be deleted by selecting the border with a single
									click and then pressing the backspace key. If a text or music
									area is accidentally deleted, the undo feature (Edit -> Undo)
									can be used to recover it. Clicking inside the text or music
									area allows the user to edit the contents of that area.</p>
								<h5 id="visual-tour">Visual Tour</h5>
								<p>There are 4 main areas on the screen to understand with
									Drum Score Editor, no matter whether you're using Windows or
									Mac:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Menus & Toolbars</li>
									<li>Rudiment Libraries (Studio Edition only)</li>
									<li>Main Score Editing Area</li>
									<li>Editing Actions Toolbox</li>
								</ol>
								<img src="images/fulltour.png" />
								<p />
								<h5 id="menus">Menus</h5>
								<p>The location of which differs between Windows and Mac OS,
									however the main menu structure is the same. On Windows the
									menu appears across the top of the window, on Mac OS it’s
									across the top of the screen.</p>
								<p>Many items on the menus have accelerator keystrokes.
									Access to these differs between Windows and Mac OS and the
									relevant standards are followed, E.G using the CMD key on Mac
									and Ctrl on Windows. The accelerator keys appear on the menus
									as expected.</p>

								<h5>File</h5>
								<p>As is standard across most graphical applications these
									days, the File menu gives access to options for creating new
									scores (either blank ones, or starting the wizard to generate a
									score layout), opening existing score files, saving, printing
									(and print setup) and lastly accessing the score properties
									settings. Additionally on Windows, the Exit option is here to
									end the program. On Mac OS, the standard is respected and a
									Quit option appears on the application menu.</p>

								<h5>Edit</h5>
								<p>From the Edit menu, undo and redo can be actioned, as
									well as cut, copy, paste and select all actions.</p>
								<p>The Page menu item here controls whether the Text and
									Music areas on the score can be selected, moved, resized and
									deleted. This is useful as it prevents accidental movement of
									these areas when working on score content. There’s two menu
									items below called bars and notes repectively. These become
									accessible if a music area is being edited. If bars is selected
									then editing actions in the music area will affect bars and all
									other items except notes. Notes can be edited if the Notes
									entry on this menu is selected.</p>
								<p>On Windows systems an Options menu item here can be
									selected which opens a window within which a license key can be
									applied, or, for licensed users the general options for new
									scores can be specified (On Mac systems this appears in the
									Drum Score Editor -> Preferences menu).</p>

								<h5>View</h5>
								<p>The view menu allows the various toolbars to be hidden,
									zoom levels to be controlled, and (licensed studio edition
									only) management of rudiments libraries.</p>

								<h5>Insert</h5>
								<p>New text or music areas can be created here. Once
									selected, the score is shaded and the cursor turns to a
									cross-hair indicating the user should click on the page where
									the new area is to be created. Also, if focused inside a music
									area, menu items for inserting new staff lines are enabled.</p>

								<h5>Format</h5>
								<p>From here various options are available for changing the
									layout of the selected text or music area.</p>
								<b>Text Area</b>
								<p>The text content of the selected text area can be marked
									as Bold, Italic or Underlined. The remaining options on the
									Text area apply to the entire text area that’s being edited.
									The Point Size can be set between 8 and 16 points, and can be
									aligned left, right or centre. Only two fonts are available in
									the current version, Serif and SanSerif.</p>
								<b>Music Area</b>
								<p>The current staff line being edited can be deleted from
									here, or a new one added above or below. The point size for the
									music can be set between 18 and 48 points.</p>
