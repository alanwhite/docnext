								<h5>Overview</h5>
								<p>A music area is used to contain one or more staff lines,
									each containing bar lines, notes and other required musical
									symbols to create a score.</p>
								<p>Music areas can be created manually from the Insert menu,
									however due to the complex number of options and infinite
									variability in how these can be laid, it is strongly
									recommended to generate the main music area on any page.</p>
								<p>The user can control the base point size used for drawing
									and printing all the symbols in a area form the Format -> Music
									menu option. Please note setting the point size is a change to
									how the user wants the score displayed and printed, i.e. the
									contents are drawn smaller larger according to the point size,
									as opposed to zooming the page which is used to temporarily
									achieve finer control over note placement or better visibility
									on small screens.</p>
								<h5>Staff Lines</h5>
								<p>Each Music Area contains one or more Staff Lines on which
									the music is laid out. Adding or removing staff lines from the
									music area can be achieved using the menu options available at
									Format -> Music, or additional staff lines from the Insert
									menu. For speed of editing the keystrokes below are also
									available.</p>

										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>

								<h5>Navigating Around A Staff Area</h5>
								<p>Click (or tab) inside a music area and a flashing cursor
									becomes visible indicating where the next note will be
									inserted. The arrow keys move the cursor one unit in each
									direction,e.g. the up arrow moves the cursor up one staff line,
									the right arrow moves the cursor one step along the staff line.</p>
								<p>Each horizontal step on a staff line is 1/72nd of an
									inch, at an actual size zoom. If the score is zoomed to 200%
									then each step is 1/36 of an inch. As can be seen by this, some
									very fine control over placement of notes can be achieved by
									using the zoom feature.</p>
								<p>The Backspace key has a special function when there's no
									selection in a music area. The backspace key will cause the
									caret to move to the right hand edge of the note immediately to
									it's left, i.e. moves the caret backwards to just after the
									first note it finds. Pressing Backspace again, whilst the caret
									is placed immediately to the right of a note has the effect of
									selecting that note and moving the caret to left hand side of
									the note. If the user presses Backspace at this point, the note
									will be deleted, as defined below in the selection keystroke
									actions.</p>
								<p>This means the backspace key can be used to skip
									backwards along a line positioning itself and deleting notes on
									the way. If there are no prior notes on the line the caret will
									be moved to the start of the line. If the caret is already at
									the start of the line it moves up the prior line and positions
									itself just after the last note on that line.</p>
								<p>The above description applies equally to bar lines if
									Edit -> Bar is ticked, and may exclude notes if Bar -> Notes is
									unticked, this would be the case for example if the user wanted
									to delete only bar lines using the backspace key as perhaps new
									ones are to be entered aligned differently.</p>
								<p>While editing a music area, the space bar can be used to
									move to the next bar line. The cursor is placed at the start of
									the first note in the next bar, if the next bar is empty it's
									placed at the very start of the bar. This means that when the
									next bar line is the last one on the line, and the next line
									has space for an anacrusis which isn't used, the cursor stays
									on the bar line at the end of that line. If there is an
									anacrusis, the cursor is placed at the start of it's first
									note.</p>

								<h5>Entering Notes, Bars & Time Signatures</h5>
								<p>Each music area contains a caret, or cursor, which
									indicates where new notes, bars or other items will be
									inserted. Every item that appears on a staff line can be
									entered using the buttons on the toolbox or, for the more
									advanced user with a single keystroke, similar in the way text
									is added when typing a new paragraph or characters in a word
									processor.
								<p></p>
								When a new note is typed, the cursor moves the appropriate
								distance along the staff line, as determined by the duration of
								the note just typed. This positions the cursor in the correct
								relative position for the next note. This smart spacing feature
								can be disabled as preferred in the options tab in the
								properties settings accessed using the File->Properties menu
								item.

								<h5>Selecting Notes, Bars, Time Signatures & Clef Symbols</h5>
								<p>Any items on a staff line can be selected using actions
									familiar to word processor users. Either using the shift and
									arrow keys to select in the direction away from the current
									caret position, or using click and drag gestures with the
									mouse. Also, a single click while the shift key is held down
									will result in all items between the caret and click position
									to become selected.</p>
								<p>A user can control which types of items on a staff line
									are selected with the above processes by using the Edit->Bars
									and Edit->Notes options on the main menu. If the Notes option
									is ticked, then select actions will apply to notes and rests,
									and if the Bars option is ticked bars and other items will also
									be selected. This is a useful feature if a user has spent time
									creating a custom layout of bars and wants to avoid
									inadvertently moving bar markers when manipulating notes. When
									the generator is used to create a score layout, the Bars option
									is automatically unticked.</p>
								<p>When shift and arrow is used to move the end of the
									selection area to include the next note along, the caret is
									left at the end of the note in the direction of the arrow.
									Meaning if the user selects from the right using the short and
									arrow key combinations, the caret is left positioned exactly at
									the place the left most selected note starts. This can be
									useful for inserting or pasting notes in exactly that position
									on different lines, helping with complete alignment.</p>
								<h5>Performing Actions on Selected Items on a Staff Line</h5>
								<p>Once items on a staff line are selected a number of
									actions can be performed on the selection, once again using
									either the associated buttons on the toolbox, or for advanced
									speed a single keystroke. Many of the more advanced features
									are only available by keystroke, for example shift-u and
									shift-l.</p>

								<h5>Text Tags</h5>
								<p>Text can be attached to each note, rest or bar line (i.e.
									any element) on a staff. Select the element that is to have the
									text attached to it and use ctrl-t to add or delete the text
									entry. The advantage of text tags in the music area as opposed
									to the current ability to add text areas anywhere on the page
									is that they stay aligned with the element they're attached to.
									This means when an additional staff line is added or removed,
									the text tag moves with the note, rest or bar line it's
									attached to. Similarly if you move that element along the staff
									line, cut, copy or paste it, the text moves with it.</p>
								<p>A text tag can be aligned horizontally around the element
									it's attached to. By clicking inside the text tag and using the
									Format -> Text menu, all the text formatting options can be
									applied. By selecting Align Left, the text tag starts with the
									first character above the element. Selecting Align Right causes
									the text tag to finish above the element. Align Centre does as
									expected, with the text tag centred over the element.</p>
								<p>The text is styled using the same menu options, once
									again click inside the text tag and use the Format -> Text menu
									options to apply bold, italic or underline styling, change the
									font between serif or sans-serif, and alter the point size
									between the pre-selected sizes.</p>
								<p>The last option is to be able to position the text either
									above or below the element it's attached to. Click inside the
									text tag and use the Alt and UP or DOWN arrow together to move
									it above or below. Currently the distance above or below the
									staff line is fixed, but the capability is in the software to
									add actions to customize the distance in future versions.</p>
