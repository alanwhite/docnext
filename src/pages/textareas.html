								<h5>Overview</h5>
								<p>The intended purpose of the text areas is to present the
									title, author, dates or any required text. There's no
									restriction on what can be typed in the text areas. Text areas
									have a transparent background and will always sit in front of
									any music, which also allows them to be used for any
									annotations required on the score.</p>
								<p>Simple Formatting is supported, with a choice of a few
									basic fonts and font sizes, plus the usual styles, bold, italic
									and underline. Also the text can be aligned to the left, centre
									or right of the containing area. To alter these properties
									click inside the text box and used the Format -> Text menu
									option.</p>
								<h5>Text Substitutions</h5>
								<p>The text in text areas can either be typed in directly or
									can reference various score properties. When editing the
									content of a text area, if the contents start with a % sign,
									Drum Score Editor will use the remainder of the contents to
									look up the score properties for the associated value.
									Currently the following substitutions are supported:</p>
								<table>
									<thead>
										<tr>
											<th width="200">Variable</th>
											<th>Value</th>
										</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>%title</td>
											<td>The title of the drum score</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>%author</td>
											<td>The author of the drum score</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>%band</td>
											<td>The name of the band the score was written for</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>%filename</td>
											<td>The full name of the file containing the score on
												the local PC / laptop</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>%tunetype</td>
											<td>The type of tune, the intended use of this field is
												to document if it's a March, Reel etc</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>%version</td>
											<td>The version of the score as documented by the author</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
								<p>The content of all these variables is taken from the
									score properties, accessed from the File -> Properties menu
									option. When the score generator is used to create a new score
									these are populated with answers provided by the user at
									generation time.</p>
