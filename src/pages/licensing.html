								<h5>Overview</h5>
								<p>
									Although time is given freely, there are numerous costs that
									mount up for developer rights and certificates as well as
									hosting and distribution costs and helping cover those is much
									appreciated. In return for contributing, some helpful
									productivity features are enabled which we call studio
									features, these are covered in detail <a
										href="studiofeatures.html">here</a>.</p>
								<h5>Obtaining a license</h5>
								<p>First sign in on the main website <a href="https://www.drumscore.scot">DrumScore.Scot</a></p>

								<p><img src="assets/img/dsesigning.png"></p>

								<p>
									 You can either create an account there or use your Facebook or Google login.
									 The use of Facebook or Google to login is strongly encouraged as it prevents the need to
									 remember yet another password for a website! It's secure and I don't get access
									 to any of your Facebook or Google data.</p>
								<p>Once signed in, you'll be taken to the licenses view, where any existing licenses you
									may have purchased will appear, and the opportunity to buy a license. </p>

								<p><img src="assets/img/dsebuynow.png"></p>

								<p>Note there is no need to acquire a separate license for
									each PC or laptop you own. The same key works on any machine
									you use, the license is tied to your identity and email address
									only. This does mean you could generously just give others your
									license key, however that means Drum Score Editor isn't getting
									the support it needs and your identity is being added to their
									machines.</p>
								<p>Click the Buy Now button to be taken to a PayPal
									payment page where you can either use a card or a PayPal
									account if you have one to pay the displayed fee.</p>

								<p><img src="assets/img/dsepaypalpaid.png"></p>

								<p>Once PayPal confirms payment, a license key is generated
									and appears in your list of licenses. Sometimes it takes many
									minutes for PayPal to confirm dependant on the card. Please
									return to <a href="https://www.drumscore.scot">DrumScore.Scot</a>
									to pick up your new license key. Use the Copy to Clipboard button to
									save the license key details ready to paste to Drum Score Editor in
									the next step.
								</p>

								<h5>Applying the license key</h5>
								<p>Start Drum Score Editor and then use the menus to
									navigate to the license dialog.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>On Microsoft Windows this is Edit->Options</li>
									<li>On Apple Mac OS X it's Drum Score Editor->Preferences</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Once the dialog is displayed, paste the license key you copied in the step
									above into the area provided and click apply.</p>

								<p><img src="assets/img/licprefdialog.png" /></p>

								<p>Next close down Drum Score Editor completely, as license
									checks are performed when the app starts and features enabled
									as appropriate.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>On Microsoft Windows it's File->Exit</li>
									<li>On Apple Mac OS X it's Drum Score Editor->Quit</li>
								</ul>
