								</ul>
								<p>Each of these is described in detail below.</p>
								<h5>Rudiment Libraries</h5>
								<p>These appear on the left hand side of the workspace and
									allow you to drag and drop your most used and favourite phrases
									and rudiments ready for reuse. You can open multiple Rudiment
									Libraries, for example to store phrases from similar time
									signature together or perhaps different styles - it's up to
									you. This feature has allowed me to write scores in a fraction
									of the time it took before.</p>
								<p>Once licensed, new menu items appear on the View menu.</p>
								<img src="assets/img/rudilibmenu.png">

								<p></p>
								<p>To get started use the menu option to create a New
									Rudiment Library. Choose your filename and where to save it, it
									will automatically by suffixed as .dsl, indicating it's a Drum
									Score Library. These can be copied around machines as required.
									The filename chosen will be the default title for the library
									as it appears on the left hand side of the workspace, so for
									example if you saved a new rudiment library called "Strathspey
									Phrases", it would appear as follows:</p>
								<img src="assets/img/rudilibs.png">

								<p></p>
								<p>The libary is of course empty, until you start to
									populate it with your most used phrases. If you have several
									scores, e.g. strathspeys as in the example above, start by
									opening them, selecting phrases you use repeatedly and dragging
									and dropping them on them on the rudiment pane on the left.</p>
								<p>A pro-tip is not to save both left-hand and right-hand
									versions of phrases you use, just keep one, to save on space on
									the screen, and when you drop it in, select it and use shift-k
									to swap the hands of all notes in the phrase.</p>
								<p>You can create, open and use multiple rudiment libraries,
									one approach could be to keep one library for each time
									signature, or tune type, or maybe you want to keep reference
									libraries of common 2/4 endings. It's really down to
									discovering what works best for you as you work through
									creating drum scores. You'll notice as you start to work with
									multiple rudiment libraries that by clicking on the title of a
									library it expands and shows the phrases it contains, and the
									other rudiment libraries compress to just their titles being
									visible.</p>
								<p>If you change your mind, and want to delete a phrase from
									a library, first select it by clicking on it, then click the
									"-" button at the bottom of the rudiment panel area.</p>
								<p>The properties button at the bottom of the rudiment panel
									area is used to alter the properties of the rudiment library
									currently focused.</p>

								<p>
								<h5>Logos & Images</h5>
								<p>Insert your band logo or other images for whatever purpose
									you intend. <a href="imageareas.html">Image Areas documentation</a></p>

								<h5>Saving as PDF, JPEG, PNG, SVG</h5>
								<p>After applying the license key and restarting Drum Score
									Editor a new menu option appears on the File menu that allows
									the current score to be exported in various formats.</p>
								<img src="assets/img/exportmenus.png">



								<p>
								<h6>Export as PDF</h6>
								<p>This has been a common request, especially for Microsoft
									Windows users as they don't have a native PDF creation
									capability, unlike the Apple Mac where it's built in. Even on
									the Mac though this feature saves a number of keystrokes to
									access the print dialogs and save as PDF.</p>
								<h6>Export as JPG</h6>
								<p>This feature allows the whole score to be saved as a jpeg
									compressed picture, with a solid white background. This is a
									useful option for creating images for websites or adding to
									other documents</p>
								<h6>Export as PNG</h6>
								<p>
								Similar to the JPG export, this feature allows the whole score
								to be saved as a png compressed picture, but with a transparent
								background. This is a useful option for creating images for
								websites, adding to other documents or even maybe sending to
								printers to have a score rendered on a t-shirt or other media!
								</p>
								<h6>Export as SVG</h6>
								<p>This feature allows the whole score to be saved as a
									scalable vector graphics file, with a solid white background.
									This is a useful option for producing high quality images that
									don't lose quality as they're scaled. This is much more useful
									for advanced web site images, and allows printers or others to
									retain the quality of the score if for example scaled to fit a
									larger surface.</p>
								<p></p>
								<h5>Clone staff line</h5>
								<p>Accessed via the Format | Staff menu, this feature clones
									the line that the cursor is on. It's a shortcut for inserting a
									line, copying all the notes and bar lines from the source line,
									moving to the target and pasting them. With this there's no
									need to check if Edit | Bars is on or not in order to be able
									to copy the whole content.</p>
								<p></p>
								<h5>1st and 2nd time workflow</h5>
								<p>This is the first workflow which analyses the content of
									the score to make decisions about what actions to take. It's
									purpose is to simplify the process of taking an ending line to
									a part and creating a 2nd time, where the author might want a
									different setting. This workflow takes care of the "admin"
									around doing that.</p>
								<img src="assets/img/before1st.png">

								<p>If the cursor is placed on a staff line, which as a
									double repeat close bar marker at the end of it, and the
									workflow is triggered from the Format | Music menu, it will
									create a 2nd time for that line, by inserting a new staff line
									underneath it, copying all the contents of the line down,
									removing any unison markings and switching the bar marker at
									the end of the line to one that doesn't contain repeat markers.</p>
								<img src="assets/img/after1st.png">

								<p>It also adds a text tag to the first element of the
									repeated line saying "2nd Time" and similarly adds a text tag
									to mark "1st Time" on the first element of the first time line.</p>
								<p>To get the best results, always ensure the repeat bar
									marker line is not pushed too far to the right on the source
									line. If this is the case the workflow will not be able to
									create the ending bar line on the 2nd time. Simply switch on
									bar line editing with the Edit | Bar menu and move the bar line
									in to the left until it's completely visible. There are ways
									this can be tidied up in a future release.</p>
								<p>If the the cursor is placed on a 2nd time line as created
									above and the workflow is triggered, it will remove the second
									line and the "1st Time" text tag from the line above,
									effectively toggling off the 2nd time line. Any changes made to
									the 2nd time line are lost, with the exception that like all
									actions in Drum Score Editor undo will put it back.</p>
								<p></p>
								<h5>New Score Preferences</h5>
								<p>Deafult options used when generating new scores can be set. This
									is useful if the authors preference is to always use certain
									custom values including font size, band name, author name,
									unison highlighting or not, colours used for other highlights,
									traditional note heads or strikes instead.</p>

								<p>
									<br /> This dialog is accessed by the Edit -> Options menu
									item on Windows, Drum Score Editor -> Preferences on Mac.
								<p></p>
								<h5>Workspace Preferences</h5>
								<p>A couple of convenience features become available in the
									studio edition.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Workspace size and position on screen is retained at
										close</li>
									<li>Horizontal toolbar positions preserved, if swapped
										sides</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Block Selection</h5>
								<p>Now you can switch to block select mode (check the item
									on the Edit menu) and your selections are now made in a block
									mode, I.E. if you start at the first note in the 2nd bar on one
									line and select up to the last note in the 2nd bar on the next
									line down, only the notes in the 2nd bar on both lines become
									selected, rather than all the notes in between.</p>
								<p>Why is this useful? Well perhaps you have a 2/4 and you
									want to copy and paste bars 3 and 4, the middles, and bars 7
									and 8, the ending to another part, you can do that with one
									select, copy and paste.</p>
								<h5>Vertically Align Notes</h5>
								<p>There are many times when you look at the first note in a
									bar across multiple lines and want to make them all line up,
									i.e. start at exactly the same distance in the bar on different
									lines. If you're really adept at selection and keyboard work
									it's possible to do this by hand, albeit a bit timeconsuming.</p>
								<p>Left Align tools combined with Block Selection help make
									this much simpler. If you want to say align the first notes of
									bar 2 across the whole score, you switch block selection on
									(see above, Edit -> Block Select), then drag the mouse to
									create a block selection where the first note of bar 2 is the
									first note in the selection on each line, then use Format ->
									Music -> Left Align Selection and the first selected notes on
									each line align to whichever one was furthest to the left.</p>
								<p>This approach counts grace notes, so if one line it's a
									simple note and on the next line it's a note with a flam, then
									the start of the flam is the start of the note, so it may not
									give you what you want. In which case the Left Align Selection
									Stems is what you want. This aligns all the notes to the left
									most note stem as opposed to grace note. This is probably what
									most people will want.</p>
								<h5>Squeeze/Expand Runs of Notes</h5>
								<p>Sometimes you want the notes you've entered to be all
									closer together, and it's time consuming to go move them
									individually. This tool allows you to compress and expand a
									selection of notes.</p>
								<p>Select 3 or more notes on a single line and you'll see
									little grab boxes in the top and bottom corners of the
									selection. If you click and drag within one of those boxes, it
									compresses or expands the selection, maintaining the same
									relative distance between each note. If you're dragging out the
									way it increases the distance, if you're dragging in the way it
									reduces the distance - proportionately.</p>
								<h5>Beautify Your Score</h5>
								<p>The beautify feature is accessed from the Format -> Music
									menu, or the alt-b hotkey. This feature takes all the notes in
									the music area and positions them logically where they "should"
									be between bar lines. So what does "should" mean?</p>
								<p>It starts by placing the first note in the bar a short
									distance within and then considers the duration of that note
									and places the next note the right distance from it. It caters
									for irregular groups. Remember if you don't like what it's done
									you can aways use undo as per any other function in Drum Score
									Editor.</p>
								<p>A few things to consider.
								<ul>
									<li>Grace notes - these throw the spacing terribly so Drum
										Score tries to place the stem of the note that has a flam or
										rough etc as close to where it should be as possible.
										Obviously the grace note could push it further along than it
										should be. Drum Score is then in debt in terms of space in the
										bar, so takes as much as possible from the next note. If
										that's not enough it robs the next one and so on. Consider
										reducing the point size of your music area if your most
										complex run of roughs, flame and drags in a bar just mess up.
									</li>
									<li>A dotted note is supposed to be half as long again
										musically as it's value suggests. Similarly a cut note is half
										the duration. So when laying out notes as clinically as that I
										found the score looked so pointed even the most pointed of
										pipers would go whoah silver! So I made it 1.33 times longer
										and 0.66 of the duration for dots and cuts respectively.
										Similarly for double dots.</li>
									<li>If you see notes all bunched up at the end of a bar,
										you've got too many in the bar. No I haven't you say! Make
										sure you've not forgotten that fiddly triplet group - that's
										the favourite thing I've found in people's scores when
										testing, none of mine of course, ahem, cough cough.</li>
									<li>Similarly if you see lots of space at the end of a
										bar, maybe there's not enough notes in there or they're the
										wrong duration?i</li>
									<li>Strathspeys. We all write them wrong. Every one of us,
										me included and will continue to do so - go on tell me you
										don't! It's supposed to be that each beat note subdivides into
										3, and we optionally chuck a triplet sign above (or below) the
										group to show this. Optionally because some believe saying the
										tune type is strathspey is enough for folks to know when
										there's 3 (or subdivisions thereof) we should just know, you
										know. Anyway this is a long explanation to say beautify
										doesn't have a meaningful relationship with some of these
										subjective opinions yet - it will do it's job on a strathspey
										but you'll see quickly that dot and cut should actually be a
										note-rest-note setup to respect the metre. I can see this
										being a debate .....</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Bar Note Checking</h5>
								<p>If you've got too many notes in a bar a red wavy line
									appears under it, too few and it's a blue wavy line. It
									considers the time signature in effect too, so if there's none
									on the staff lines, it uses the time signature in the score
									properties.</p>
									<img src="assets/img/baraudit.png">
								<h5>Autobeam</h5>
								<p>No need to go through your score telling it when to join
									the tails of quavers and smaller notes, or figure where the
									primary subdivision of the beat is to put a single line. Just
									saved yourself another whole bunch of time, and brain strain!</p>
									<img src="assets/img/autobeam.png">
								<h5>Multimedia Studio</h5>
								<p>Intended to be used in 3 phases. Firstly get comfortable playing along,
									set the tempo etc, then record an audio track, review and refine, and
									finally produce an mp4 movie of the score, with the intended interpretation
									in the audio track, at the tempo specified, and the score animated
									with a ball arcing between beat notes.</p>
									<img src="assets/img/mediastudio.png">
									<p></p>
								<h5>Watermark</h5>
								<p>Allows specification of a watermark on the score. This allows
									the author to set any text, how heavy and how large that text appears
									on the page. It is visible on the screen, printer, PDF and MP4s, and can
									be used for copyright info, identifying who the score has been issued to
									or whtever purpose you choose!</p>
