								<h5>Overview</h5>
								<p>Stored with each score are a set of values or properties
									which define the score and determine how it will appear on the
									screen. Many of these are initially set when the score is
									generated or are set to a default value within Drum Score
									Editor. For convenience, licensed users can specify many of
									these default values that will be used every time a score is
									generated, for example an individuals preference might be to
									always write scores where unison is highlighted in purple, or
									always show triplets below the staff note for example - by
									specifying as a default preference it avoids having to set it
									manually each time after a score is generated.</p>
								<p>There are two major groupings of properties that can be
									set, the general attributes of a score such as the title,
									author etc, and then the options which determine how the score
									is represented such as unison colour or lines. All these are
									accessed through the File -> Properties menu item, or the
									spanner icon on the toolbar, both of which, given this is all
									about settings properties of a score, are only enabled if
									there's a score loaded.</p>
								<h5>Properties</h5>
								<p>The first tab in the Score Properties dialog deals with
									the core attributes of the score as shown.</p>

											<th width="200">Name</th>
											<th>Value</th>

									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Title</td>
											<td>The title of the drum score</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Author</td>
											<td>The author of the drum score</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Band</td>
											<td>The name of the band the score was written for</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Version</td>
											<td>The version number the author wants stored with the
												score</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Tune Type</td>
											<td>The type of tune, the intended use of this field is
												to document if it's a March, Reel etc. Drum Score Editor
												uses this at score generation time to determine number of
												bars in a part, repeats etc however it's also used in some
												of the more advanced features for automatically
												re-positioning notes</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Time Signature</td>
											<td>The time signature of the score. The options are to
												use either Common (4/4) or Cut Common (2/2) or specify
												manually the time signature wanted. This information is
												provided and used at initial score generation and then when
												determining smart spacing and re-positioning of notes in
												some of the more advanced features. Note changes in time
												signature can be noted within a music area however only the
												time signature specified here is considered during advanced
												layout features.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Bpm</td>
											<td>Beats Per Minute. This is documentary only at this
												stage and specifies the intended pace the score was written
												for.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Font & Font Size</td>
											<td>The font face size that will be used for any new
												text areas inserted.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Filename</td>
											<td>The filename this score was last saved as. It can't
												be set here, this is displayed for informational purposes
												only.</td>

								<h5>Options</h5>
								<p>The options tab deals with various ways the score can be

										<tr>
											<th width="200">Option</th>
											<th>Value</th>
										</tr>

									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Draw line above Unison</td>
											<td>Setting this option results in a line being drawn
												above any note or phrases marked as unison in the score</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Use colour to highlight unison</td>
											<td>Many drummers take a score and use a highlighter pen
												to more easily see the unison sections. This option allows
												Drum Score Editor to do that bit for you.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Colour to highlight unison</td>
											<td>If you are going to use colour to highlight unison,
												this lets you determine which colour will be used.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Change highlighter colours</td>
											<td>Many authors use different highlight colours to mean
												different things. There are 6 possible pens to use which
												Drum Score editor and the colour they each draw is
												determined here</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Use modern roll notation</td>
											<td>Scores can get really busy, to keep them cleaner the
												author can specify that only one strike through a note stem
												is used to signify a roll. Traditionalist sight readers
												don't like this, and want the two or sometimes 3 strikes.
												The number of strikes through the stem doesn't really mean
												much in modern drumming. Happy to discuss the musical theory
												behind them but it's mostly history.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Use lines for note heads</td>
											<td>Some authors prefer to use a line for the note head
												rather that the elipse. How to differentiate between a minim
												and a crotchet is beyond this humble drummer when these are
												used.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Proportional Spacing</td>
											<td>Have Drum Score Editor automatically advance the
												cursor the right distance when entering notes.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Roll ties below accents</td>
											<td>Determine placement of where ties that signify rolls
												start and end. On occasion the author may wish to have them
												appear above accents in a score.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Irregular groups below notes</td>
											<td>Have Drum Score Editor put triplets and other
												irregular groups below the notes rather than above. Can be
												useful for decluttering scores.</td>
										</tr>
